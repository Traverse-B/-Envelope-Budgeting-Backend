# Envelope-Budgeting-Backend

For your viewing pleasure:  A RESTful API with a persistent, home-brewed database using node.js and Express 


##Introduction

The Envelope Budgeting Backend is a toy API created with Node.js and Express to demonstrate my ability to build, debug, and maintain the backend of a functional website.  

The Envelope Budgeting Backend is a RESTful API that allows one to create user accounts, build a budgeting profile for each user based on "envelope" objects that maintain balances for different purposes and can be updated to deposit, withdraw, or transfer funds.

The Envelope Budgeting Backend comes with a working database that automatically maintains a back-up of all data in a .json file so the server can be turned off and on without losing data.  

All routes have been tested for correct responses to requests with proper as well as improper data.  With a suitable front-end and a few finishing touches, the site could be deployed in production.

##Installation

Download all files into the root folder
test.http allows you to try out the routes.  Install REST Client add-on for VS Code, open the file in VS Code, and click on the requests you want to send.

More to come!
